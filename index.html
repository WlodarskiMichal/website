                <p class="displayed-text">
                    I was born in Poland, I moved quite a lot, looking for my place and better future. I started with programming when still Pokemon cards were a thing, but I couldn't grasp it back then. I tried one more time in 2014, signing myself to University, for Computer Science course, but I couldn't sustain myself financially. Finally in 2016 I fled to Edinburgh, Scotland and stayed there for almost 5 years. During this time I did some courses for programmers (Java, Full Stack Web), and when was ready for the market, Covid-19 came through, and we all stayed put. <br>
                    In late 2020 I decided to move to Germany with my fiancee, and here we are building our new center of life. I'm working hard to have my dream come true, becoming a software developer, but I was tiny bit lost for few years. Now I'm going through one Full Stack Web boot camp, hoping to understand more, and create better projects. <br><br>

                    Job experience:<br>
                    I been working all my adult life, various jobs, everywhere. The ones that I'm most proud of is: Supervisor of a Restaurant in Edinburgh, and Site Manager of Events in Edinburgh. I don't have any IT experience except the projects that I'm creating, day in, day out.<br><br>

                    Education:<br>
                    I've done Java course in Edinburgh ITPT school. Then CodeClan Full Stack Web Development, I was working with FreeCodeCamp for few months, as well as CodeGym. Currently I'm on Flavio Full Stack Bootcamp. I'm trying to get to University to start Computer Engineering, but that I'm gonna do along full time job. <br><br>

                    What I'm looking for:<br>
                    I am looking for company that I can help grow as a Junior Web Developer. Or alternatively I might take some Freelance projects. I'm currently working on some local businesses websites. We can meet for a coffee, online or in 2 meters distance and chat about it. I'm gonna update the website when new projects are gonna be finished.  <br><br>
