Project made as a Portfolio website, created only with JS, CSS and HTML, deployed on Github Pages. 
I made it responsive and mobile friendly, I'm planning to use it as my website for longer period of time, and add new projects there. 
It's focus is to showcase projects that I did, and that I was part of.
